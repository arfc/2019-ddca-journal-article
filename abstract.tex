The present United States nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder 
the expansion of nuclear energy technology. 
The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle 
options we could transition to, which would make nuclear energy technology
more desirable. 
To successfully analyze the transition from our current 
fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles, we need a nuclear 
fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically 
deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. 
In this work, we developed demand-driven deployment capabilities in 
\Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator.  
User-controlled capabilities such as supply buffers, 
facility preferences, prediction algorithms, and installed capacity 
deployment were introduced to give users tools to minimize power 
undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. 
We demonstrate \deploy's capability to automatically deploy fuel 
cycle facilities to set up transition scenarios for promising 
nuclear fuel cycle options.
