The present United States' nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder 
the expansion of nuclear energy technology. 
The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle 
options, which make nuclear energy technology
more desirable. 
Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current 
fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear 
fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically 
deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. 
This work introduces and demonstrates demand-driven deployment 
capabilities in \Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework.  
User-controlled capabilities such as time series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, 
and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power 
undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. 
The demand-driven deployment capabilities are refered to as \deploy. 
We demonstrate \deploy's capability to predict future commodities' 
supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel 
cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. 
Using \deploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user 
simulation set-up time compared to previous efforts that
required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error 
to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle 
facilities.
