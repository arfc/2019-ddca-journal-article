The present United States nuclear fuel cycle is faced with 
challenges that hinder expansion of nuclear energy technology. 
The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options 
we could transition to, that would make nuclear energy technology
more desirable. 
To successfully analyze the transition from out current fuel cycle 
to these promising fuel cycles, we need
a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically 
deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. 
In this work, we developed demand-driven deployment 
capabilities in \Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator.  
User-controlled capabilities such as supply buffers, 
facility preferences, prediction algorithms, and installed 
capacity deployment were introduced to give a user tools to minimize 
power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. 
We demonstrate \deploy's capability 
to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to set up 
transition scenarios for promising nuclear fuel cycle options.
