\section{Introduction}
Nuclear fuel cycle simulators are used to evaluate the impact of 
alternative nuclear fuel cycles at both high and low resolution. 
These simulators track the flow of materials through the nuclear fuel cycle, 
from enrichment to final disposal of the fuel, while also accounting for 
decay and transmutation of isotopes. 
By evaluating performance metrics of different fuel cycles, we gain an 
understanding of how each facility's parameters and technology choices 
impact the system's performance. 
Therefore, these results can be used to guide research 
efforts, advise future design choices, and provide 
decision-makers with a transparent tool for evaluating \gls{FCO} 
to inform big-picture policy decisions \cite{yacout_modeling_2005}.

Many fuel cycle simulators automatically deploy reactor facilities 
to meet a user-defined power demand. 
However, the user must define a deployment scheme of 
supporting facilities to avoid gaps in the supply 
chain resulting in idle reactor capacity. 
Current simulators require the user to set infinite capacity 
for supporting facilities but this inaccurately represents 
reality resulting in misrepresented results. 
Manually determining a deployment scheme for a once-through 
fuel cycle is straightforward, however, for complex fuel cycle 
scenarios, it is not.   
To ease setting up realistic nuclear fuel cycle simulations, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator
must bring dynamic demand-responsive deployment decisions into 
the simulation logic \cite{huff_current_2017}. 
Thus, a next-generation nuclear fuel cycle simulator must predictively and 
automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined 
power demand. 

In \Cyclus, an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, 
each entity (i.e. \texttt{Region}, \texttt{Institution}, or \texttt{Facility}) in the 
fuel cycle is an agent. 
\texttt{Region} agents represent geographical or political areas that \texttt{Institution}
and \texttt{Facility} agents reside. 
\texttt{Institution} agents control the 
deployment and decommission of \texttt{Facility} agents 
and represent legal operating organizations such ass
utilities, governments, etc. \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
\texttt{Facility} agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities
such as mines, conversion facilities, reactors, reprocessing facilities, 
etc. 
\Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014}
provides basic \texttt{Region}, \texttt{Institution}, 
and \texttt{Facility} archetypes compatible with \Cyclus. 

\subsection{Context of Work}
The impact of climate change on natural and human systems 
is increasingly apparent.
The production and use of energy contribute to 
two-thirds of the total Green House Gas (GHG) 
emissions \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.
Furthermore, as the human population increases and previously 
under-developed nations urbanize rapidly, 
global energy demand is forecasted to increase.  
Power generation technology choices 
will heavily impact the effects of growing energy demand 
on climate change.  
Large scale nuclear power plant deployment has significant 
potential to reduce GHG production due nuclear energy's low 
carbon emissions \cite{noauthor_climate_2018}.  

However, large scale nuclear power deployment faces
challenges of cost, safety, and used nuclear fuel  
\cite{petti_future_2018}. 
Nuclear power has high capital costs, 
an unresolved long-term nuclear waste management 
strategy and perceived adverse safety, environmental, and health 
effects \cite{petti_future_2018}. 
The nuclear power industry must overcome these challenges 
to ensure continued global use and expansion 
of nuclear energy technology. 

The challenges described above are associated with 
the present once-through fuel cycle in the \gls{US}, 
in which fabricated nuclear fuel is used once and placed into 
storage to await disposal. 
An evaluation and screening study of a comprehensive set of nuclear 
fuel cycle options \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014} was conducted to assess 
for promising \glspl{EG} with performance improvements compared with 
the existing once-through 
fuel cycle (EG01) in the \gls{US} across a wide range of criteria. 
Fuel cycles that involved continuous recycling
of co-extracted U/Pu or U/TRU in fast spectrum critical reactors
consistently scored high on overall performance.  
Table \ref{tab:eg} describes these fuel cycles:
EG23, EG24, EG29, and EG30.

The evaluation and screening study assumed
the nuclear energy systems were at equilibrium to understand 
the end-state benefits of each \gls{EG} \cite{feng_standardized_2016}. 
In the current work, our goal is to model the transition from the initial EG01
state to these promising future end-states without assuming equilibrium
fuel cycles. 
To successfully analyze time-dependent transition
scenarios, the nuclear fuel cycle simulator tool must 
automate the transition scenario simulation setup. 
Therefore, the Demand-Driven \Cycamore Archetypes project
(NEUP-FY16-10512) was initiated to develop 
demand-driven deployment capabilities in \Cyclus. 
This capability, \deploy, is a \Cyclus \texttt{Institution}
agent that deploys facilities to meet user-defined power demand. 

\subsection{Novelty}
We utilized time series forecasting methods to effectively predict 
future commodities' supply and demand in \deploy. 
Solar and wind power generation commonly use these methods
to make future predictions based on past time series data
\cite{reikard_predicting_2009,diagne_review_2013,soman_review_2010,taylor_wind_2009}. 
Industrial supply chain management also use sophisticated time series 
forecasting techniques to predict demand for quantities of goods 
in the supply chain \cite{souza_supply_2014}.
This is a novel approach that has never been applied to 
nuclear fuel cycle simulators. 

\subsection{Objectives}

\Cyclus, 
(2) to describe the prediction methods available in 
\deploy, and

EG01-23, EG01-24, EG01-29, and EG01-30 transition scenarios
