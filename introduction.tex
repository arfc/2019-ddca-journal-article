\section{Introduction}
% This is taken from my global paper (how to cite?/Should i paraphrase)
For many fuel cycle simulators, it is currently up to the user 
to define a deployment scheme of supporting facilities to ensure 
that there is no gap in the supply chain. 
To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, a \gls{NFCSim}
should bring demand responsive deployment decisions into 
the dynamics of the simulation logic \cite{huff_current_2017}. 
Thus, a next generation \gls{NFCSim} should predictively and 
automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user defined 
power demand. 

\Cyclus is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework 
\cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
In \Cyclus, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the 
fuel cycle is an agent. 
Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution
and facility agents can be grouped into. 
Institution agents control the 
deployment and decommission of facility agents 
and represents legal operating organizations such as a 
utility, government, etc. \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. 
\Cycamore \cite{carlsen_cycamore_2014}
provides agents to represent process physics of various 
components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment 
facility, reactor). 

\subsection{Context of Work}
An evaluation and screening study of a comprehensive set of nuclear 
\gls{FCO} \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014} was conducted to assess 
for performance improvements compared the existing once-through 
fuel cycle (EG01) in the \gls{US} across a wide range of criteria. 
It was found that fuel cycles that consistently scored high 
overall performance involved continuous recycling
of co-extracted U/Pu or U/TRU in fast spectrum critical reactors. 
In the study, these fuel cycles were referred to as EG23, EG24, 
EG29 and EG30. 
Table \ref{tab:eg} provides a description of each of these fuel 
cycles.

The evaluation and screening study was performed assuming that 
the nuclear energy system is at an equilibrium to understand 
the end-state benefits. 
Therefore, based on the results from the study, the next step is 
to understand and evaluate the transition from the initial EG01
state to these promising future end-states 
\cite{feng_standardized_2016}. 
To successfully conduct analysis of the time-dependent transition
analyses, it is necessary to develop \gls{NFCSim} tools to  
ease the setting up of transition scenarios. 
Therefore, Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetypes project
(NEUP-FY16-10512) was initiated to develop demand-driven deployment 
capabilities in \Cyclus. 

This capability is added as a \Cyclus Institution
agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end 
fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. 
This demand-driven deployment capability is called 
\deploy. 

\subsection{Objectives}
The main objectives of this paper are: 
(1) to describe the demand driven deployment capabilities of 
\Cyclus, (2) to describe the prediction methods available in 
\deploy, (3) to demonstrate the use of \deploy in setting up 
transition scenarios with various power demand curves, and (4) 
to compare setting up transition scenarios in \Cyclus with and 
without \deploy.
