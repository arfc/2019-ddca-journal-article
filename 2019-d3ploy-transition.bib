	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

	abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

As with all simulation tools, fuel cycle simulators require verification through unit tests, benchmark cases, and integral tests. Model validation is a vital aspect, as well. Although comparative studies have been performed, there is no comprehensive unit test and benchmark library for fuel cycle simulator tools. The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

	title = {Current {Status} of {Predictive} {Transition} {Capability} in {Fuel} {Cycle} {Simulation}},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, NFC simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a NFC simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current NFC simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},

This paper shows that numerical optimization can be used to better identify impacts of fuel cycle policies and condense the generated data against a few significant criteria. The once-through cycle is considered the baseline case, while advanced technologies with fuel recycling characterize the alternative fuel cycle options available in the future. The options include, among others, recycling the fissile materials from spent light water reactor fuel in fast reactors (FRs) as well as deployment of innovative recycling reactor technologies, such as the 235U initiated FRs. Additionally, a first-of-a-kind optimization scheme for the nuclear fuel cycle analysis is described. Optimization metrics of interest to different stakeholders in the fuel cycle (economics, fuel resource utilization, high-level waste, transuranic materials/proliferation management, and environmental impact) are utilized for two different optimization techniques: a linear one and a stochastic one. Stakeholder elicitation provided sets of relative weights for the identified metrics appropriate to each stakeholder group, which were then used to demonstrate feasibility of arrival at optimum fuel cycle configurations for recycling technologies. The stochastic optimization tool, based on a genetic algorithm, was used to identify noninferior solutions according to Pareto’s dominance approach to optimization. The main trade-off for fuel cycle optimization was found to be between emphasizing economics versus most of the other identified metrics.},

To best reduce reliance on fossil fuels while ensuring reliable energy generation and profitability, nuclear renewable hybrid energy systems (NRHESs) focus on tightly coupling renewable generation with a NPP by colocating the generation sources in an industrial park. The industrial park consists of at least the NPP, the renewable energy source, and some form of industrial process that consumes the energy not used by the grid. In this paper, we analyze the computational modeling approaches currently being pursued for NRHESs. We further investigate similarities between nuclear fuel cycle simulators (NFCSs) and NRHESs to determine how NRHES development can benefit from the development of NFCSs. This paper begins by reviewing past research on NRHESs to determine the necessary functionality of modeling software. After determining the necessary software capabilities for an NRHES model, we discuss the characteristics of a NFCS. The characteristics found common to both systems include desirability of a flexible modular design; open source; ability to be coupled to external pieces of software, including economic modeling, optimization methods, and sensitivity analysis; and results that are usable to technical and nontechnical people alike.},
