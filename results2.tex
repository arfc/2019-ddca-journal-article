\subsection{Comparison of Prediction Methods}

EG01-EG23, EG01-EG24, EG01-EG29, and EG01-EG30 transition scenarios
are set up in \Cyclus using \deploy. 
To determine the most effective \deploy prediction methods, a
comparison of each prediction method for each 
transition scenarios is conducted for constant power 
and linearly increasing power demand. 
Similar to the basic transition scenarios, these transition scenario 
simulations begin with an initial fleet of \glspl{LWR} and after 
80 years, the simulation progressively decommissions the \glspl{LWR}, 
and \deploy deploys \glspl{SFR} and \gls{MOX} \glspl{LWR} to meet 
the unmet power demand. 
Figure \ref{fig:eg2329}
show the set up of facilities and mass flows for 
EG1-23 and EG1-29 in \Cyclus. 
In EG1-23 and EG1-29, only plutonium is recycled from \gls{LWR}
spent fuel to produce \gls{FR} fuel. 
EG1-24 and EG1-30 are the same as EG1-23 and EG1-29 respectively,
with exception that all transuranic elements are recycled.

Figure \ref{fig:eg23under} shows the time steps in which there is undersupply 
or under capacity of each commodity for a constant power EG01-23 scenario for 
varying prediction methods.
The size of the points are normalized to the largest undersupply
value, therefore, the bigger the point, the larger the undersupply. 
Table \ref{tab:all-power} shows the number of time steps with power 
undersupply for constant power EG01-EG23 and EG01-29, 
linearly increasing power EG01-24 and EG01-30 transition scenarios. 
Figure \ref{fig:eg23under} demonstrates that the \texttt{poly} and 
\texttt{fft} methods perform the best, since they have the least number 
of points on the plot, indicating that they have the fewest number of time 
steps with undersupply and under capacity of commodities. 
Table \ref{tab:all-power} shows that the \texttt{poly} method performs slightly 
better at minimizing under supply of power than \texttt{fft}.
A similar analysis was done for a constant power EG1-29 scenario, and 
it is seen in Table \ref{tab:all-power} that the \texttt{poly} also performed 
best for minimizing under supply of power.  

Figure \ref{fig:eg24under} shows the time steps in which there is undersupply 
or under capacity of each commodity for a linearly increasing power EG01-24 
scenario for varying prediction methods.
Similarly to Figure \ref{fig:eg23under}, the size of the points are normalized 
to the largest undersupply value. 
Figure \ref{fig:eg24under} demonstrates that the \texttt{fft} method 
performs the best at minimizing under supply of all commodities.
A similar analysis was done for a constant power EG1-30 scenario, and 
it is seen in Table \ref{tab:all-power} that the \texttt{fft} also performed 
best for minimizing under supply of power.

From Figures \ref{fig:eg23under}, \ref{fig:eg24under}, and table 
\ref{tab:all-power}, it is shown that the \texttt{poly} method 
performs best for constant power transition scenarios
and the \texttt{fft} method performs best for linearly increasing 
power transition scenarios. 
Undersupply and under capacity of commodities occur two main time periods: 
initial demand for the commodity and during the transition period.
To further \deploy's main objective of minimizing the power under supply, 
sensitivity analysis of the power supply 
buffer for each transition scenario with best performing prediction method
is conducted to find a buffer size that will minimize power 
undersupply.  

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
Sensitivity analysis of the power buffer size was conducted for 
EG01-EG23, EG01-24, EG01-29, EG01-30 transition scenarios. 
It was found that varying the power buffer size does not 
impact the number of undersupply time steps for EG01-EG23 
and EG01-29 constant power demand transition scenario with 
\texttt{poly} prediction method. 
There are 6 and 4 time steps (table \ref{tab:all-power}) 
in which there is power undersupply for EG01-EG23 and EG01-29 
transition scenarios respectively. 
As seen from figure \ref{fig:eg23under}, these undersupply time 
steps occur at the beginning of the simulation and for one 
time step when the transition begins. 
This is expected since without time series data 
at the beginning of the simulation, \deploy takes a few 
time steps to collect time series data about power demand 
to predict and start deploying reactor and supporting 
fuel cycle facilities. 
When the transition begins, power is under supplied for one 
time step, with this new time series data, \deploy deploys 
facilities to ensure that power demand is met for the 
rest of the transition period. 
Therefore, the power undersupply is minimized for constant 
power EG01-EG23 and EG01-EG29 transition scenarios with 
a 0MW power supply buffer. 

Power buffer size is varied for the EG01-EG24 and EG1-30 
linearly increasing power demand transition scenarios. 
Figures \ref{fig:eg24-bufplot}, \ref{fig:eg30-bufplot} 
and Table \ref{tab:buff_size} 
show that with an increasing buffer size, the number of 
power undersupply time steps decreases. 
For EG01-24, it plateaus at 6000MW, and for EG01-30, 
the cumulative undersupply is smallest for a buffer 
size of 8000MW.  
As seen from Figures \ref{fig:eg24-dotplot} and 
\ref{fig:eg30-dotplot}, these undersupply time 
steps occur at the beginning of the simulation and for one 
time step when the transition begins. 
This is expected since without time series data 
at the beginning of the simulation, \deploy takes a few 
time steps to collect time series data about power demand 
to predict and start deploying reactor and supporting 
fuel cycle facilities. 
Therefore, the power undersupply is minimized for linearly 
increasing power EG01-EG24 and EG01-EG30 transition scenarios with 
a 6000MW and 8000MW power supply buffer respectively.

\subsection{Best Performance Models}
Table \ref{tab:bestinputs} 
shows \deploy input parameters for
EG01-EG23, EG01-EG24, EG01-EG29, and EG01-EG30 transition scenarios
that minimizes undersupply of power and minimizes 
the undersupply and under capacity of the other facilities. 
The need for buffers for commodities is a reflection of reality
in which ideally a supply cushion exists to ensure that there 
is available supply in the case of unexpected undersupply. 

Figure \ref{fig:23stack} and \ref{fig:30stack} show
time dependent deployment of reactor and supporting facilities for 
the EG01-23 constant power demand and EG01-30 linearly increasing power demand 
transition scenario respectively. 
\deploy automatically deploys reactor and supporting facilities 
to set up a supply chain to meet power demand
during a transition from \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR} for EG01-23, 
and from \glspl{LWR} to \gls{MOX} \glspl{LWR} and \glspl{SFR} for 
EG01-30. 
EG01-24 and EG01-29 facility deployment plots are very similar to 
EG01-23 and EG01-30 respectively, therefore they are not shown.
