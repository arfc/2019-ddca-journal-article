\subsection{Demonstration of \deploy's Capabilities}
\label{sec:demo}
We conducted a simple transition scenario simulation with
linearly increasing power demand
to demonstrate \deploy's capabilities and inform input parameter 
choices when setting up complex many-facility transition scenarios. 
This simulation is defined as \textit{simple} since 
it only includes
three facility types: \texttt{source}, \texttt{reactor}, and 
\texttt{sink}. 
The simulation begins with ten \texttt{reactor} facilities 
(\texttt{reactor1} to \texttt{reactor10}). 
These reactors have staggered cycle lengths and lifetimes to prevent 
simultaneous refueling and set up gradual decommissioning. 
\deploy is configured to deploy \texttt{new reactor} facilities
to meet the loss of power supply created by the decommissioning 
of the initial \texttt{reactor} facilities. 
Table \ref{tab:demonstrations} shows the \deploy input parameters 
for this simulation.

Figures \ref{fig:growingtransition-power}, \ref{fig:growingtransition-fuel},
and \ref{fig:growingtransition-spentfuel} demonstrate \deploy's capability 
to deploy reactors and supporting facilities to minimize undersupply 
when meeting linearly increasing power demand and subsequent secondary 
commodities demand. 
In Figure \ref{fig:growingtransition-power} there exists no time steps 
in which the supply of power falls under demand, meeting the main 
objective of \deploy. 
By using a combination of the \texttt{FFT} method for 
predicting demand and a power supply buffer of 2000MW 
(the capacity of 2 reactors), we minimized the number of 
undersupplied time steps for every commodity.

In figure \ref{fig:growingtransition-fuel},
a large-throughput source facility is initially
deployed to meet the large initial fuel demand for the commissioning 
of ten reactors. 
Deployment of a large-throughput source facility for the 
first few time steps ensures \deploy does not deploy supporting
facilities that become redundant at later times in  
the simulation.
This reflects reality in which reactor manufacturers accumulate
an appropriate amount of fuel inventory before starting 
up reactors.
