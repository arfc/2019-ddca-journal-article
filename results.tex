\subsection{Demonstration of \deploy's capabilities}
\label{sec:demo}
We conducted a simple transition scenario simulation with
linearly increasing power demand
to demonstrate \deploy's capabilities and inform input parameter 
choices when setting up complex many-facility transition scenarios. 
This simulation only includes
three facility types: \texttt{source}, \texttt{reactor}, and 
\texttt{sink}. 
The simulation begins with ten \texttt{reactor} facilities 
(\texttt{reactor1} to \texttt{reactor10}). 
These reactors have staggered cycle lengths and lifetimes to prevent 
simultaneous refueling and setup gradual decommissioning. 
\deploy is configured to deploy \texttt{new reactor} facilities
to meet the loss of power supply created by the decommissioning 
of the initial \texttt{reactor} facilities. 
Table \ref{tab:demonstrations} shows the \deploy input parameters 
for this simulation.

Figures \ref{fig:growingtransition-power}, \ref{fig:growingtransition-fuel},
and \ref{fig:growingtransition-spentfuel} demonstrate \deploy's capability 
to deploy reactor and supporting facilities to meet the linearly increasing
power demand and subsequently demanded secondary commodities with 
minimal undersupply.
In Figure \ref{fig:growingtransition-power} there exists no time steps 
in which the supply of power falls under demand, meeting the main 
objective of \deploy. 
By using a combination of the \texttt{FFT} method for 
predicting demand and a power supply buffer of 2000MW 
(the capacity of 2 reactors), we minimized the number of 
undersupplied time steps for every commodity.

In figure \ref{fig:growingtransition-fuel},
a large-throughput source facility is initially
deployed to meet the large initial fuel demand for the commissioning 
of ten reactors. 
By having a large-throughput source facility exist for the 
first few time steps, \deploy does not deploy supporting
facilities that become redundant at later times in  
the simulation.
This reflects reality in which reactor manufacturers accumulate
an appropriate amount of fuel inventory before starting 
up reactors. 
There is one time step in which a power undersupply exists after the 
decommissioning of the large initial facility; 
this is unavoidable as the prediction methods in \deploy are 
unable to foresee this sudden drop in demand.
