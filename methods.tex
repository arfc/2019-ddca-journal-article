\section{Methodology}
%Description of D3ploy
In a \Cyclus \gls{NFC} simulation, at every timestep, \deploy 
predicts supply and demand of each commodity for the next time 
step. 
If there is an undersupply of any commodity based 
on the predicted values, \deploy deploys facilities to meet 
the predicted demand.  
Figure \ref{fig:flow} shows the logic flow of \deploy 
at every timestep.

\Deploy's overall objective is to ensure that there is no 
undersupply of power. 
The sub-objectives are : (1) to minimize the number of time 
steps of undersupply or under capacity of any 
commodity, (2) to minimize excessive oversupply of all commodities.
This is a reflection of reality in which it is important to 
never have an undersupply of power on the grid by ensuring power 
plants are never undersupplied of fuel, while not 
having excessive over supply resulting in a burden to store unused 
supplies. 
One of the key issues that \gls{NFCSim}s face is that despite
sufficient installed reactor capacity to meet the power 
demand, there is insufficient supply of fabricated/reprocessed 
fuel at certain timesteps, resulting in idle capacity.  

\subsection{Structure}
%Description of front end and back end of fuel cycle 
%Demand Driven vs. Supply Driven 
In \deploy, two different institutions were implemented for 
front-end and back-end fuel cycle facilities: 
\texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst} and 
\texttt{SupplyDriven} 
\noindent
\texttt{DeploymentInst} respectively. 
This distinction was made because front-end facilities 
are deployed to meet demand for the commodity they produce. 
Whereas, back-end facility are deployed to meet supply for the 
commodity they provide capacity for. 
For example, for front end facilities, a reactor facility 
demands fuel and \texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst} 
triggers deployment of fuel fabrication facilities to create 
supply meeting demand for fuel to prevent undersupply. 
For back end facilities, the reactor generates spent fuel and 
\texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst} triggers deployment of 
waste storage facilities to create capacity meeting the supply 
of spent fuel to prevent under capacity. 

\subsection{Input Variables}
Table \ref{tab:inputs} lists and gives examples of the input 
variables \deploy accepts. 
Essentially, the user must define the facilities controlled by 
\deploy, their respective capacities, the driving commodity, 
its demand equation, deployment driving method, and prediction method 
for supply and demand. 
The user also has the optional option to define supply/capacity buffers 
for each commodity, facility preferences, and facility constraints. 
In-depth descriptions of the deployment driving method, prediction 
methods, and buffers are provided in the subsequent sections.

\subsubsection{Deployment Driving Method}
The user has the choice of deploying facilities based on the difference 
between predicted supply and demand, or predicted demand and 
installed capacity. 
There are two advantages of using installed capacity over predicted 
supply. 
First, to prevent over deployment of facilities that have an
intermittent supply. 
For example, reactor facilities have a periodic refueling time. 
A user might not want \deploy to deploy more reactor facilities 
to make up for the lack of power supply caused by the gap in 
supply during refueling. 
Second, to prevent infinite deployment of a facility that uses 
a commodity that is no longer available in the simulation. 
For example, in a transition scenario from \gls{LWR}s to \gls{SFR}s, 
the reprocessing plant that fabricates \gls{SFR} fuel might demand 
Pu after the inventory accumulated by \gls{LWR}s is used up 
and there are no more \gls{LWR} facilities to generate Pu. 
This will result in \deploy deploying infinite reprocessing 
facilities to generate \gls{SFR} fuel despite the lack of input Pu 
to generate it. 
This can be avoided by using \deploy's facility constraint capability 
to constrain \gls{SFR} deployment until a sizable inventory of Pu 
is accumulated in the simulation. 

\subsubsection{Supply/Capacity Buffer}
In \texttt{DemandDrivenDeploymentInst}, the user has the option 
to provide a supply buffer for each commodity so that 
\deploy will deploy facilities to meet predicted demand and the
additional buffer value. 
In \texttt{SupplyDrivenDeploymentInst}, the user has the option 
to provide a capacity buffer to specific commodities so that 
\deploy will deploy facilities to meet predicted supply and the
additional buffer.
For example, the user could set the power commodity's supply buffer 
to be 2000 MW. 
If predicted demand is 10000 MW, \deploy will deploy reactor 
facilities to meet the predicted demand and supply buffer, resulting 
in a power supply of 12000 MW.  
The buffer can be defined as a percentage (equation \ref{eq:perc}) 
or absolute value (equation \ref{eq:abs}). 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:perc}
    S_{pwb} = S_{p}*(1+d)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:abs}
    S_{pwb} = S_{p}+a
\end{equation}
where $S_{pwb}$ is predicted supply/capacity with buffer, 
$S_p$ is the predicted supply/capacity without buffer, 
$d$ is the percentage value in decimal form, 
and $a$ is the absolute value of the buffer. 

Using a combination of this buffer capability with the 
installed capacity deployment driving method in a transition 
scenario simulation is effective in minimizing undersupply of a 
commodity without having excessive over supply. 
This is demonstrated in section \ref{sec:demo}. 

\subsection{Preferences}
% Need to explain the order of preferences for deployment 
% Constraint, pref, minimize number of facilities and minimize 
% over supply 
The user has the option to provide each facility with
a time dependent preference equation that governs preference for 
that facility compared to other facilities that provide the same 
commodity. 
In the example for facility preferences in table \ref{tab:inputs}, 
the \gls{LWR} reactor has a preference of $100-t$ and the 
\gls{SFR} reactor has a preference of $t-100$. 
Thus, the \gls{LWR} is preferred before time step 100 and \gls{SFR}
is preferred after. 

The user also has the option to provide each facility with a 
commodity constraint. 
In the example for facility constraint in table \ref{tab:inputs}, 
the \gls{SFR} has a commodity constraint of 5000kg of Pu. 
This constrains \gls{SFR} deployment by the size of the Pu inventory 
in the simulation. 
Once, the 5000kg Pu inventory is first met, \gls{SFR} reactors can 
henceforth be deployed. 

One of the key issues faced in transition scenarios is the lack 
of Pu in a scenario that results in idle advanced reactor capacity. 
Therefore, the facility preferences and constraint capabilities 
are useful and necessary for modeling transition scenarios. 
An ideal transition year is selected using the facility 
preferences, however the transition will only begin when there 
is sufficient Pu inventory (set by facility constraint) 
to avoid Pu shortages. 

Therefore, when \deploy predicts an undersupply of a commodity, 
it deploys available facilities to meet the predicted demand. 
It will deploy the facility with the highest preference first, 
unless it does not meet it's constrained criteria, then it will 
deploy the second most, and so on. 
If the facilities do not have preferences or constraints, \deploy 
will deploy the available facilities to minimize the number of 
deployed facilities while minimizing oversupply of the commodity.

\subsection{Prediction Methods}
\Deploy records supply and demand values at every timestep for all 
commodities. 
This provides time series data for \deploy's time series 
forecasting methods to predict future supply and demand for each 
commodity.  
Two main types of methods are investigated: non-optimizing and 
deterministic time series forecasting methods.

The reason for implementing multiple methods is that for different 
user-defined power demand curves, \deploy input parameters
, and types of supporting facilities in the simulation,
\gls{NFC} transition scenario simulations will respond differently. 
Therefore, conducting a comparison of each method for each type of 
simulation will determine which method is most effective for 
each simulation. 

The prediction methods will be described in the following 
sections. 

\subsubsection{Non-Optimizing Methods}
Non-optimizing methods include: Moving Average (MA), \gls{ARMA}, 
\gls{ARCH}. 
The MA method calculates the moving average of 
a user defined number of previous entries in a commodity's 
time series. 

The \gls{ARMA} method is a combination of an autoregressive term, 
and a moving average term. 
The \gls{ARMA} method is more accurate than the MA method 
because of this autoregressive term. xz 

\subsubsection{Deterministic Methods}
Deterministic methods include: \gls{FFT}, polynomial fit, 
exponential smoothing, and triple exponential smoothing 
(holt-winters).
