\section{Future Work}
To enable NFCSims to produce insightful and flexible results
to inform policy decisions, it is necessary to
quantify and include all the subtleties of each segment of the NFC
through system analysis and sensitivity studies 
\cite{passerini_systematic_2014}. 
We simulate transition scenarios to predict the future, however 
when implemented in the real world, 
it will deviate from the optimal scenario.
Previously it was difficult to conduct this analysis with \Cyclus 
as the user would have to 
manually calculate the deployment scheme for every change in input 
parameter. 
Therefore, using the \deploy capability,
sensitivity analysis studies can be more easily 
conducted to determine how variation in different 
input parameters will impact the progression and final state of 
a transition scenario.
