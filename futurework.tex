\section{Future Work}
We simulate transition scenarios to predict the future; 
however, when implemented in the real world, the transition 
scenario tend to deviate from the optimal scenario.
Therefore, \gls{NFC} simulators must be used to conduct
sensitivity analysis studies to understand the subtleties of 
a transition scenario better to reliably inform policy decisions.
Previously it was difficult to conduct sensitivity analysis with \Cyclus 
as users have to manually calculate the deployment scheme for a 
single change in an input parameter. 
By using the \deploy capability,
sensitivity analysis studies are more efficiently 
conducted to determine how variation in different 
input parameters impact the progress and final state of 
a transition scenario.
